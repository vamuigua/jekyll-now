title: Algorithm Analysis
---
-An algorithm is a set of instructions to be followed to solve a problem.<br>

-There can be more than one algorithm (solution) to solve a given problem.<br>
   Example of real life case scenario:Buying a phone far away;you can order it via online shopping ,sending someone or also getting it yourself.<br>

-An algorithm can be solved using different languages on different platforms thus help reduce on **Complexity**.<br>

-You also need to factor in how long a certain algorithm needs to compute.<br>

-Analysis on algorithm helps determine whether how useful it is.<br>

-Having a correct algorithm helps determine the **efficiency** of that algorithm.<br>

-Efficiency is important so as to archive maximum performance.<br>

  **Time Compelxity (Execution Time)**<br>
-Time Complexity of an algorithm quantifies the **amount of time taken** by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the input; Example on Google Search when searching for *'cars'* takes *'0.58 secs*<br>

-Its basically the time taken to Build, Compile and Output a result.<br>

-It's broken down into:<br>
<ol>
  1.**Worst-case Complexity** - When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is *maximum.*<br>
  2.**Average-case Complexity** - When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is *average.*<br>
  3.**Best-case Complexity** - When the amount of time required by an algorithm for a given input is *minimum.*<br>
  </ol>

**What is Space Compelxity?**<br>
-Data structures that take space.<br>

**Asymptotic Analysis**<br>

**Asymptotic** - denotes a condition where a a line tends to meat a curve but they do not intersect.<br>

*What is Asymptotic Analysis*<br>
-This is the kind of Analysis done to *calculate the Complexity* of an algorithm its theoretical Analysis.<br>
-A large length of input is used to calculate the Complexity function of the algorithm.<br>

**Asymptotic Notations**<br>
-Asymptotic Notations are languages that allow us to *analyze* an algorithm's running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases. This is also known as an **algorithm's growth rate.**

-Include the:<br>
<ul>
<li>*The Big-O-Notation* Ο </li>
<li>*Omega* Ω </li>
<li>*Theta* θ </li>
</ul>
